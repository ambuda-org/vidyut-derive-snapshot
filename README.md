vidyut-gen
==========

vidyut-gen generates Sanskrit words with their prakriyās (derivations)
according to the rules of *pāṇinīya-vyākaraṇa*. The project aims to be:

1. *correct*. If a Sanskrit word is valid, vidyut-gen should generate it. If a
   Sanskrit word is not valid, vidyut-gen must not generate it. 

2. *conformant*. Any prakriyā that vidyut-gen generates should conform to the
   tradition. Ideally, there should be little sign that a prakriyā was
   generated by a computer.

3. *clean and readable*. The source code should be accessible to all, and the
   project should be welcome to all contributors.

4. *fast*. Fast code is easier to run, test, and safely modify.
